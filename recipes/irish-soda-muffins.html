            <h1>Irish Soda Muffins</h1>
            <h3>This is one of my favorite new recipes. These muffins taste like Irish Soda Bread. Unlike their namesake, however, baking powder is used to create a denser, bread-like texture. You can substitute baking soda to create a much fluffier, lighter muffin, but part of what I like best about this recipe is that the muffins are like miniature loaves rather than miniature cakes. To each their own!</h3>

                <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F.</li>
                <br>
                <p><strong>372g / 3 cups all purpose flour</strong></p>
                <p><strong>48g / ¼ cup sugar</strong></p>
                <p><strong>1 teaspoon baking powder</strong></p>
                <p><strong>1 teaspoon Kosher salt</strong></p>
                <li>In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
                <br>
                <p><strong>½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, chilled</strong></p>
                <li>Put the butter in the bowl and cut into small pieces using a pastry blender or two dull table knives until the butter is the size of peas. Mix well.</li>
                <br>
                <p><strong>40g / ¼ cup regular raisins</strong></p>
                <p><strong>40g / ¼ cup golden raisins</strong></p>
                <li>Add raisins to flour mixture and stir with a spatula or wooden spoon to combine.</li>
                <br>
                <p><strong>1 ¼ cups buttermilk</strong></p>
                <li>Pour buttermilk in bowl and mix well with a spatula or wooden spoon until a rough dough has formed and all of the ingredients have combined.</li>
                <li>Turn dough out onto a clean work surface and knead a few times to incorporate ingredients. Shape into a 3/4-inch thick circle or rectangle. Using a bench scraper or dull knife, cut into 12 equally sizes pieces. Place each piece into the well of a muffin tin and push down gentle to fill.</li>
                <li>Bake at 425°F until the tops are golden brown, about 12-13 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove from oven and let cool on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Remove muffins from the pan. Serve warm. Leftover muffins will keep in an airtight container for 3 days.</li>
