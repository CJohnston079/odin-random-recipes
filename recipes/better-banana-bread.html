Mash bananas in a large oven-safe bowl.
Place bowl in cold oven and preheat oven to 350°F. Remove from preheating oven once bananas have warmed slightly and they have released some of their juices, about 5 to 10 minutes. Set aside.

1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
In a separate, medium bowl whisk flours, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and spices.
