                <li>Whisk together the flour, soda, powder, cocoa, and salt, set aside.</li>
                <br>
                <p><strong>½ oz. red gel food coloring</strong></p>

                <li>In a large measuring cup combine the food coloring and buttermilk, set aside.</li>
                <br>
                <p><strong>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature</strong></p>
                <p><strong>1 cup canola oil</strong></p>
                <p><strong>606g / 3 cups sugar</strong></p>
                <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together the butter, oil, and sugar until light and fluffy (mixture should be pale and white), about 4 minutes.</li>
                <br>

                <li>Add in the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition and scraping down the bowl as necessary.</li>

                <li>In three batches, add the dry ingredients to the bowl, alternating with the dyed buttermilk, mixing well after each addition and scraping the bowl to fully incorporate all ingredients.</li>
                <li>Divide batter evenly among prepared pans and bake until centers are set and edges begin to pull away from the sides of the pans, about 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove from oven and allow to cool on rack for 10 minutes before turning out of pans and cooling to room temperature before frosting.</li>
