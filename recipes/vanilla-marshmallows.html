            <h1>Vanilla Marshmallows</h1>
            <h3>Marshmallows can be a wonderful treat but store bought marshmallows are full of high frutcose corn syrup and several chemicals that you'll have trouble pronouncing. However, with a little bit of sugar and gelatin you can easily make your own marshmallows at home.</h3>

            <ol>
                <p><strong>Cooking spray</strong></p>
                <li>Lightly grease a 9x13 baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Line baking dish with parchment and grease again. Set aside.</li>
                <br>
                <p><strong>3 cups sugar</strong></p>
                <p><strong>1 ¼ cups light corn syrup</strong></p>
                <p><strong>¾ cup water</strong></p>
                <p><strong>¼ teaspoon salt</strong></p>
                <li>Combine sugar, corn syrup, water, and salt in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve sugar.</li>
                <li>Once sugar has dissolved, cook without stirring until mixture registers 240°F on a candy thermometer (the soft-ball stage).</li>
                <br>
                <p><strong>1 ounce unflavored gelatin (4 envelopes)</strong></p>
                <p><strong>¾ cup water</strong></p>
                <li>While sugar cooks, combine gelatin and water in a large bowl or bowl of a stand mixer (if using). Set aside.</li>
                <li>Once sugar syrup has reached 240°F, remove from heat. Using an electric hand mixer or stand mixer with a whisk attachment set on low speed, gradually pour hot sugar syrup into the gelatin mixture. Increase speed to high and beat until mixture is very stiff, about 12 minutes.</li>
                <br>
                <p><strong>2 tablespoons vanilla extract</strong></p>
                <li>Beat vanilla into mixture until combined, about 30 additional seconds.</li>
                <li>Pour mixture into prepared baking dish. Smooth surface with spatula and let sit, uncovered, until firm, about 3 hours.</li>
                <br>
                <p><strong>¼ cup confectioners sugar</strong></p>
                <li>Generously coat a clean work surface with confectioners sugar. Remove firmed marshmallow sheet from baking sheet and place on sugared surface.</li>
                <li>Lightly brush a sharp knife with confectioners sugar and cut marshmallows into 1-inch squares (or desired size).</li>
                <br>
                <p><strong>½ cup confectioners sugar in a bowl</strong></p>
                <li>Gently roll each cut marshmallow in confectioners sugar until fully coated, shaking off excess sugar.</li>
                <li>Store marshmallows in an air tight container. Marshmallows will keep for six weeks at room temperature or for up to a year in the freezer.</li>
