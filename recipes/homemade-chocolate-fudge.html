            <h1>Homemade Chocolate Fudge</h1>
            <h3>This recipe has been passed down from my Great Grandma Pearl's and Mamie Eisenhower. My Aunt makes this every year and it was always one of my favorite holiday treats. This can made several weeks in advance and stored tightly wrapped in aluminum foil.</h3>

                <p><strong>Â½ cup butter</strong></p>
                <p><strong>768g / 4 cups sugar</strong></p>
                <li>In a large saucepan that's not over heat, combine butter, evaporated milk, and sugar. Stir until sugar dissolves.</li>
                <li>Place saucepan on stove over low heat. Stir constantly for 5 to 10 minutes until it reaches a watery consistency. Don't rush this process or the fudge may not set properly.</li>
                <li>Bring to a slow boil by increasing to medium heat. Cover and boil for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove saucepan from heat to add remaining ingredients.</li>
                <br>
                <p><strong>283g / 10 ounces mini marshmallows</strong></p>
                <li>Add marshmallows to saucepan and stir with a wooden spoon until completely dissolved.<li>
                <br>

                <br>

                <li>Add semi-sweet chocolate to saucepan and stir until completely dissolved. If necessary, return saucepan to still warm burner for added residual heat, but do not turn stove back on.</li>
                <br>

                <p><strong>224g / 2 cups walnuts, chopped</strong></p>
                <li>Add to saucepan and stir until combined.</li>
                <li>Turn fudge over onto a large cutting board or baking sheet to let bottom dry completely, approximately 1 to 2 hours.</li>
                <li>Cut into 2-inch squares and wrap each square tightly in aluminum foil. Fudge will last 3 to 4 weeks.</li>
