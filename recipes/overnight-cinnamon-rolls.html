            <h2>Stage 1: Dough</h2>
            <ol>
                <p><strong>Cooking spray</strong></p>
                <li>Grease a large bowl and set aside.</li>
                <br>
                <p><strong>10 tablespoons butter, cut into 1-inch pieces</strong></p>
                <li>Let butter come to room temperature. Alternately, microwave on low setting until soft, about 1 minute. Set aside.</li>
                <br>
                <p><strong>¾ cup whole milk, warmed</strong></p>
                <li>Heat milk in microwave on high until 100°F to 110°F, about 1 minute. Put in a medium bowl.</li>
                <br>
                <p><strong>4 large eggs</strong></p>
                <p><strong>84g / ¼ cup honey</strong></p>
                <li>Add the eggs and honey to the bowl with milk. Whisk to combine. Set aside.</li>
                <br>
                <p><strong>540g / 4 ½ cups all-purpose flour</strong></p>
                <p><strong>10g / 2 ¼ teaspoons instant yeast</strong></p>
                <p><strong>14g / 2 teaspoons salt</strong></p>
                <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle, mix the flour, yeast, and salt on low until combined, about 30 seconds.</li>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Reserved milk-egg-honey mixture</strong></p>
                <li>While running on low, add the milk-egg-honey mixture. Mix until combined, about 1 minute.</li>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Reserved butter</strong></p>
                <li>While running on low, add butter one piece at a time. Once all of the pieces have been added, increase speed to medium and beat until all the little butter pieces are incorporated, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Transfer to a lightly greased bowl. The dough will be very sticky and you may need a spatula to scrape the dough into the bowl.</li>
                <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise for 30 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
            <hr>
            <h2>Stage 2: Rising and Folding</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Using your hands or a spatula, fold the dough up and over onto itself. Turn the bowl 20*, fold dough onto itself, and repeat until it's been folded 8 to 10 times. Re-cover the bowl with plastic and let rise for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Repeat this series of folding three more times, for a total of four times and a net rise of 2 hours.</li>
                <li>Tightly cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight or up to 72 hours.</li>
            </ol>
            <hr>
            <h2>Stage 3: Assembly</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove dough from fridge. On a generously floured work surface, knead the dough until smooth, about 3 minutes. Shape into a ball, dust with flour, and cover with a tea towel to let it come to room temperature, about 20-30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Grease an 9x13 inch pan and/or line it with parchment paper for easier clean up.</li>
            </ol>
            <hr>
            <h2>Stage 4: Filling</h2>
            <ol>
                <p><strong>144g / ¾ cup light brown sugar</strong></p>
                <p><strong>2 teaspoons cinnamon</strong></p>
                <p><strong>¼ teaspoon cloves</strong></p>
                <p><strong>1/8 teaspoon salt</strong></p>
                <li>In a medium bowl, combine light brown sugar, cinnamon, cloves, and salt. Set aside.</li>
                <br>
                <p><strong>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled</strong></p>
                <li>Roll dough out into a 16x12 inch rectangle. Using a pastry brush, coat one side with butter.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle reserved sugar-and-spice mixture evenly on the dough. Using the long edge, roll the dough into a tight ball, pressing it to seal.</li>
                <li>Using a sharp knife, scissors, bench scraper, or thin string, cut the dough into 12 equal sized pieces. Place into prepared pan.</li>
                <li>Cover pan and place back in fridge to let rise overnight or up to 18 hours.</li>
            </ol>
            <hr>
            <h2>Stage 5: Baking</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>The next morning, remove tray from the fridge and let come to room temperature, about 30 to 45 minutes. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position. Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
                <li>Uncover tray and bake until rolls are golden brown, about 27 to 32 minutes. While the rolls are baking, prepare the icing.</li>
                <li>Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
            <hr>
            <h2>Stage 6: Frosting</h2>
            <ol>
                <p><strong>8 tablespoons butter, room temperature</strong></p>
                <p><strong>4 ounces cream cheese, room temperature</strong></p>
                <li>In a large bowl, beat butter and cream cheese with an electric hand mixer until smooth and creamy.</li>
                <br>
                <p><strong>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</strong></p>
                <p><strong>¼ teaspoon salt</strong></p>
                <li>Add the vanilla and salt and mix on low to combine.</li>
                <br>
                <p><strong>114g / 1 cup confectioners' sugar</strong></p>
                <li>Add the confectioners' sugar and mix on low until combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and mix on medium until the icing is light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Using an offset spatula or table knife, apply a thin layer of the cream cheese icing to the rolls after they have cooled for 5 minutes, using about one-third of the mixture.</li>
                <li>Let the rolls cool for another 15 to 20 minutes. Top with the rest of the icing and serve.</li>
